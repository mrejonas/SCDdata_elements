standing_height_desc_1,demographics,"SCDO Demographics:  Anthropomorphic",descriptive,"Ask the participant to remove hair ornaments, jewelry, buns, or braids from the top of the head that interfere with the measurement. Shoes should be removed.
Ask the participant to stand erect against the backboard with the body weight evenly distributed and both feet flat on the stadiometer platform (Exhibit 1) . The participant's feet should be positioned with the heels together and toes pointed slightly outward at approximately a 60 degree angle. Check to be sure that the back of the head, shoulder blades, buttocks, and heels make contact with the backboard of the stadiometer.
NOTE: Depending on the overall body conformation of the individual, all four contact points - head, shoulders, buttocks, and heels - may or may not touch the stadiometer backboard (Exhibit 2). For example, elderly survey participants may have kyphosis, a forward curvature of the spine that appears as a hump at the upper back. In particular, dowager's hump is a form of kyphosis that creates a hump at the back of the neck. Additionally, some overweight survey participants cannot stand straight while touching all four contact points to the backboard. In such instances it is important to obtain the best measurement possible according to the protocol.
Stature measurements are made with the head aligned in the Frankfort horizontal plane (Exhibit 2). The head is in the Frankfort plane when the horizontal line from the ear canal to the lower border of the orbit of the eye is parallel to the floor and perpendicular to the vertical backboard (see Exhibit 2). Many people will assume this position naturally, but for some survey participants the examiner may need to gently tilt the head up or down to achieve the proper alignment. Instruct the survey participant to look straight ahead.
If you cannot position the participant such that his or her trunk remains vertical above the waist, that the arms and shoulders are relaxed, and that the head is positioned in the Frankfort plane, be sure to note this in the measurement record. This information might be useful to interpret study findings. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study 2007-08, a comment described as ""Not Straight"" is noted in the stature record.
Once positioned, lower the stadiometer headpiece so that it rests firmly on top of the participant's head, with sufficient pressure to compress the hair. Instruct the survey participant to stand as tall as possible, take a deep breath, and hold this position. The act of taking a deep breath helps straighten the spine to yield a more consistent and reproducible stature measurement. Notice that the inhalation will cause the headpiece to rise slightly.
As soon as the participant inhales, record the measurement. After recording the measurement, tell the participant to relax. Once the measurement is taken, raise the stadiometer headpiece and have the participant step away from the stadiometer.
Adjustments for shoes and hair: When participants cannot remove hair braids, buns, and headwear that interferes with the stature measurement, measure the distance from the scalp to the top of the hair with a small ruler to the nearest 0.1 cm. If shoes are worn, measure the height of the shoe heel to the nearest 0.1 cm. A corrected height value can be calculated by subtracting these distances from the original stature measurement, thus yielding an adjusted stature value.",,"PX020703 | phenx_standing_height",,,,,,,,,,,

measured_weight_desc,demographics,,descriptive,"Note: Detailed videos illustrating the procedure can be found on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) website.
A digital scale or beam balance is used to weigh participants.
Participants are asked to wear an examination gown and socks or light clothes without shoes. Only undergarments are worn beneath the gown. Infants should wear a clean diaper and t-shirt if they have not been placed in an examination gown. The procedures for obtaining the weight measurement are as follows:
The examiner briefly informs the participant that his/her weight will be measured. Participants are asked to remove objects such as cell phones, wallets, and toys from their pockets.
1. The health technician directs participants to stand in the center of the scale platform with hands at their sides and looking straight ahead.
2. The weight measurement is recorded in kilograms or pounds.
3. Special situations:
Small children: Infants and toddlers who cannot stand alone on the scale will be weighed with an adult, with an infant's scale. If an adult is holding the child, then the adult guardian or the health technician will stand alone on the scale so the scale can be tared. This sets the scale readout to zero. The child is then handed to the adult and the child's weight is measured.
If the participant is wearing a cast or medical prosthesis, make a note in the record of the location and place.
If the participant wore street clothes instead of the examination gown, make a note of this in the record. It is acceptable for infants to wear diapers or underpants and a t-shirt.
Participants should not be weighed if they are wearing shoes.
Note that special consideration may be needed for participants whose weight exceeds the capacity of the study scale. For example, weight can be obtained using two portable scales:
Have the participant stand with one foot on each portable scale.
Combine the two results to approximate the weight.
Record the weight.
If the weight equals the capacity of both portable scales, note that the weight Equals Capacity (EC) of the scales.

This manual is posted here, and is also available at the NHANES website: 2011-2012 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand.
Recording the Results of the Venipuncture Procedure
Immediately after completing the venipuncture, record the results of the blood draw, the reasons for a tube not being drawn according to the protocol, and any comments about the venipuncture.",,"PX0810601 | phenx_reticulocyte_count",,,,,,,,,,,

This manual is posted here, and is also available at the NHANES website: 2011-2012 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual.
Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand.
Recording the Results of the Venipuncture Procedure
Immediately after completing the venipuncture, record the results of the blood draw, the reasons for a tube not being drawn according to the protocol, and any comments about the venipuncture.",,PX0810801,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory Assay for Hemoglobin Characterization
The Sickle Cell Disease Scientific and Research Panel (SRSP) notes that there are numerous different assays and instruments (e.g., hemoglobin electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, high performance liquid chromatography, DNA sequencing analysis) that are appropriate to characterize hemoglobin variants. Once an assay is chosen for a particular study, the SRSP recommends that no changes in the protocol be made over the course of the study. To aid comparability, the SRSP recommends that the investigator record the make and manufacturer of equipment used and the repeatability and coefficients of variation for the assay.
The SRSP notes that investigators should record the assay results for the following hemoglobins (the exact list of hemoglobins that can be distinguished will depend on the assay being used). The hemoglobins are listed in order of the amount present with the most prevalent coming first.

The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is scored in the following way, for each domain:
Transformed Scale = [(Actual raw score - lowest possible raw score) / Possible raw score range] x 100
Three items in the emotion domain, 3f, 3h, and 3i, are reverse-scored, i.e., 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, 3 remains the same, 4 becomes 2, and 5 becomes 1, prior to manual calculation. For these items, use the following equation to compute the individual's score:
6 - individual's rating = item score

Identifying Intracranial Landmarks and Major Cerebral Arteries
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography provides visual landmarks to help correctly identify intracranial blood vessels. Correct identification of intracranial vessels relies on the diameter of the head, position of the transducer, angle of the transducer, depth of the Doppler sample, and direction of the blood flow. In adults, the diameter of the head is assumed to be 130-140 mm, whereas the head diameter must be measured due to variation of children's head sizes. In children, the bitemporal diameter is measured so that the location of the midline can be calculated (half of the diameter of the head). The internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation is the landmark that is the reference point for all other intracranial anatomy. The depth of the ICA bifurcation is estimated to usually be 10 to12 millimeters shallower than the midline.
Recording Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography Results
The results of the TCD are spectral waveform plots of velocity vs. time and the calculated velocity is the time averaged mean of the maximum velocity. Examiners should record the highest time-averaged mean blood-flow velocity in 2-millimeter increments in the following arteries:
*middle cerebral artery (at three points),
*distal internal carotid artery,
*anterior and posterior cerebral arteries, and

scoring_610102,phenx_impairment_adult,,descriptive,"Scoring:
There are two basic options for computing the summary scores for the WHODAS 2.0 short version.
Simple:
The scores assigned to each of the items-""none"" (1), ""mild"" (2) ""moderate"" (3), ""severe"" (4) and ""extreme"" (5) -are summed. This method is referred to as simple scoring because the scores from each of the items are simply added up without recoding or collapsing of response categories; thus, there is no weighting of individual items. This approach is practical to use as a hand-scoring approach and may be the method of choice in busy clinical settings or in paper-pencil interview situations. As a result, the simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains constitutes a statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of functional limitations.
Complex:
The more complex method of scoring is called ""item-response-theory"" (IRT)-based scoring. It takes into account multiple levels of difficulty for each WHODAS 2.0 item. It takes the coding for each item response as ""none,"" ""mild,"" ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" and ""extreme"" separately and then uses an algorithm to determine the summary score by differentially weighting the items and the levels of severity. The SPSS algorithm is available from WHO. The scoring has three steps:
? Step 1 - Summing of recoded item scores within each domain.
? Step 2 - Summing of all six domain scores.
? Step 3 - Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100 (where 0 = no disability; 100 = full disability).",,PX0610102,,,,,,,,,,,

Comprehension is judged from responses here as well as to all of the commands in the preceding general neurological exam.
